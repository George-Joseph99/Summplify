      "Ad sales boost Time Warner profit\n",
      "\n",
      "Quarterly profits at US media giant TimeWarner jumped 76% to $1.13bn (£600m) for the three months to December, from $639m year-earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "The firm, which is now one of the biggest investors in Google, benefited from sales of high-speed internet connections and higher advert sales. TimeWarner said fourth quarter sales rose 2% to $11.1bn from $10.9bn. Its profits were buoyed by one-off gains which offset a profit dip at Warner Bros, and less users for AOL.\n",
      "\n",
      "Time Warner said on Friday that it now owns 8% of search-engine Google. But its own internet business, AOL, had has mixed fortunes. It lost 464,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter profits were lower than in the preceding three quarters. However, the company said AOL's underlying profit before exceptional items rose 8% on the back of stronger internet advertising revenues. It hopes to increase subscribers by offering the online service free to TimeWarner internet customers and will try to sign up AOL's existing customers for high-speed broadband. TimeWarner also has to restate 2000 and 2003 results following a probe by the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), which is close to concluding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Time Warner's fourth quarter profits were slightly better than analysts' expectations. But its film division saw profits slump 27% to $284m, helped by box-office flops Alexander and Catwoman, a sharp contrast to year-earlier, when the third and final film in the Lord of the Rings trilogy boosted results. For the full-year, TimeWarner posted a profit of $3.36bn, up 27% from its 2003 performance, while revenues grew 6.4% to $42.09bn. \"Our financial performance was strong, meeting or exceeding all of our full-year objectives and greatly enhancing our flexibility,\" chairman and chief executive Richard Parsons said. For 2005, TimeWarner is projecting operating earnings growth of around 5%, and also expects higher revenue and wider profit margins.\n",
      "\n",
      "TimeWarner is to restate its accounts as part of efforts to resolve an inquiry into AOL by US market regulators. It has already offered to pay $300m to settle charges, in a deal that is under review by the SEC. The company said it was unable to estimate the amount it needed to set aside for legal reserves, which it previously set at $500m. It intends to adjust the way it accounts for a deal with German music publisher Bertelsmann's purchase of a stake in AOL Europe, which it had reported as advertising revenue. It will now book the sale of its stake in AOL Europe as a loss on the value of that stake.\n",

It lost 464,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter profits were lower than in the preceding three quarters. However, the company said AOL's underlying profit before exceptional items rose 8% on the back of stronger internet advertising revenues. TimeWarner also has to restate 2000 and 2003 results following a probe by the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), which is close to concluding. But its film division saw profits slump 27% to $284m, helped by box-office flops Alexander and Catwoman, a sharp contrast to year-earlier, when the third and final film in the Lord of the Rings trilogy boosted results. For the full-year, TimeWarner posted a profit of $3. \"Our financial performance was strong, meeting or exceeding all of our full-year objectives and greatly enhancing our flexibility,\" chairman and chief executive Richard Parsons said.\n"

      "Tory co-chairman Liam Fox was speaking after Mr Blair told Labour members the Tories offered a hard right agenda\n",
      "He would not discuss reports the party repaid £500,000 to Lord Ashcroft after he predicted an election defeat\n",
      "In what was seen as a highly personal speech in Gateshead on Sunday, Mr Blair said: I have the same passion and hunger as when I first walked through the door of 10 Downing Street\n",
      "Mr Blair said that whether the public chose Michael Howard or Mr Kennedy, it would result in a Tory government not a Labour government and a country that goes back and does not move forward\n",
      "Dr Fox accused Mr Blair and other Cabinet ministers of telling lies about their opponents policies and then attacking the lies\n",
      "The Tory co-chairman attacked Labours six new pledges as vacuous and said Mr Blair was very worried voters would take revenge for his failure to deliver\n",

      "Barbara Follet, one of the so-called Blair Babes elected in 1997, told researchers: I remember some Conservatives - whenever a Labour woman got up to speak they would take their breasts - imaginary breasts - in their hands and wiggle them and say melons as we spoke\n",
      "And ex-Tory education secretary Gillian Shepherd remembered how one of her male colleagues called all women Betty\n",
      "Prof Joni Lovenduski, who conducted the study with the help of Margaret Moran MP and a team of journalists, said she was shocked at the findings\n",
      "But she said there was a difference between the experiences of women before the 1997 intake and afterwards\n",
      "This was mainly because there were more women present in Parliament who were not prepared to put up with the sexist attitudes they came across, Prof Lovenduski said\n",
      "But she added: Some women, including the women who came in 1997, received extraordinary treatment and I am not convinced that if the number of women changed back to what it was before 1997 that things would not change back\n",

      "Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said he had always had very good and polite relations with Mr Campbell, who he described as very talented\n",

Quarterly profits at US media giant TimeWarner jumped 76% to $1.13bn (£600m) for the three months to December, from $639m year-earlier.  For the full-year, TimeWarner posted a profit of $3.36bn, up 27% from its 2003 performance, while revenues grew 6.4% to $42.09bn.  It hopes to increase subscribers by offering the online service free to TimeWarner internet customers and will try to sign up AOL's existing customers for high-speed broadband.  TimeWarner also has to restate 2000 and 2003 results following a probe by the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), which is close to concluding.  But its film division saw profits slump 27% to $284m, helped by box-office flops Alexander and Catwoman, a sharp contrast to year-earlier, when the third and final film in the Lord of the Rings trilogy boosted results.  However, the company said AOL's underlying profit before exceptional items rose 8% on the back of stronger internet advertising revenues.  It intends to adjust the way it accounts for a deal with German music publisher Bertelsmann's purchase of a stake in AOL Europe, which it had reported as advertising revenue.\n",

      "Novelist Andrea Levy is favourite to win the main Whitbread Prize book of the year award, after winning novel of the year with her book Small Island.  The judges called Guy's My Heart is My Own: The Life of Mary Queen of Scots \"an impressive and readable piece of scholarship, which cannot fail but leave the reader moved and intrigued by this most tragic and likeable of queens\". The five writers in line for the award won their respective categories - first novel, novel, biography, poetry and children's book - on 6 January.  McCaughrean, who went into magazine publishing after studying teaching, previously won the category in 1987 with A Little Lower than Angels and in 1994 with Gold Dust.  A panel of judges including Sir Trevor McDonald, actor Hugh Grant and writer Joanne Harris will decide the overall winner on Tuesday.  He is a fellow at Clare College, Cambridge and became a honorary research professor of the University of St Andrews in 2003.  One is a Jamaican who joined British troops to fight Hitler but finds life difficult out of uniform when he settles in the UK.\n",

      " India, along with China, Brazil, South Africa and Russia, has been invited to take part in the G7 meeting taking place in London on Friday and Saturday.  Separately, the IMF warned on Thursday that India's budget deficit was too large and would hamper the country's economic growth, which it forecast to be around 6.5% in the year to March 2005.  Mr Chidambaram is attending the G7 meeting as part of the G20 group of nations, which account for two thirds of the world's population. Palaniappan Chidambaram, India's finance minister, argued that these organisations need to take into account the changing world order, given India and China's integration into the global economy.  China is expected to face renewed pressure to abandon its fixed exchange rate, which G7 nations, in particular the US, have blamed for a surge in cheap Chinese exports. In London on Thursday ahead of the meeting, India's finance minister, lashed out at the restrictive trade policies of the G7 nations.\n",
